# Drum Playing Website

Drum Playing Website is a simple static and responsive web page created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It provides a virtual drum kit that allows users to play different drum sounds using either keyboard keys or by clicking on the drum items displayed on the page. This project was developed as a practice exercise while learning front-end technologies.

## Project Demo

You can view the project by clicking on the following URL: [https://harshdigi.github.io/Drum-Playing-Website/](https://harshdigi.github.io/Drum-Playing-Website/)

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the elements and layout of the web page.
- JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and functionality to the website.
- Bootstrap: Used as a front-end framework for responsive design and pre-built components.

## How It Works

1. When the website is loaded, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are loaded into the browser.
2. The HTML file provides the structure and content of the web page, including the drum items.
3. The CSS file styles the elements to create an appealing and visually pleasing layout.
4. The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the website, such as playing drum sounds when triggered by keyboard keys or mouse clicks.
5. Users can either press the corresponding keyboard keys or click on the drum items to play the associated drum sounds.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and content of the web page.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles and layout for the web page.
- `index.js`: Includes the JavaScript code for adding interactivity and functionality.
- `bootstrap.min.css`: The minified version of the Bootstrap CSS framework.

## Usage

To use the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The web page will load, and you can play the drum sounds by pressing the corresponding keyboard keys or clicking on the drum items.

## Project Customization

If you want to modify or enhance the project, you can make changes in the following files:

- `index.html`: Modify the HTML structure or content to customize the web page layout.
- `style.css`: Update the CSS styles to change the appearance and design of the web page.
- `index.js`: Modify the JavaScript code to add new drum sounds, change the key mappings, or implement additional features.

Feel free to experiment and adapt the project according to your learning goals or desired improvements.
